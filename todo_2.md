# Code Improvement To-Do List

## General Structure Improvements
- [ ] **Modularization**: Refactor code to group related functionalities into separate modules (e.g., `gitOperations.js` for Git operations).
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Move configuration details like port numbers and API keys to environment variables.
- [ ] **Utility Functions**: Create utility functions for repetitive tasks like error handling and response formatting.
- [ ] **Middleware**: Implement middleware for common tasks across multiple routes, like input validation and error logging.

## Specific Endpoint Improvements
### `/list-files`
- [ ] Enhance error messages for better debugging.

### `/clone`
- [ ] Break down the function for better readability.
- [ ] Handle specific Git errors for precise user feedback.

### `/delete`
- [ ] Implement specific error handling for file system operations.

### `/file`
- [ ] Maintain the well-implemented error handling, especially the `ENOENT` check.

### `/answer`
- [ ] Include detailed error messages and consider logging the error.

### `/stage` and `/stage-all`
- [ ] Improve Git error messages.
- [ ] Ensure that the filtered `changedFiles` array is utilized correctly in `/stage-all`.

### `/commit`
- [ ] Catch and respond with specific Git error details.

### `/history` and `/load-history`
- [ ] Add specific error details in responses for troubleshooting.

## Additional Tasks
- [ ] **Testing**: Thoroughly test each endpoint post-refactoring.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect code changes and new functionalities.
