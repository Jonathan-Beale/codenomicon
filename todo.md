# Sydney's Tasks

## Structural
We need to make sure that our proportions work in all scenarios. We need to prioritize functionality. After functionality, aesthetics and customizeability.

## AI
I would recommend you look at the way ChatGpt's system works for structural inspiration, then try styling it
- stylize the chat history, including:
- stylize the user and AI responses
- stylize the user's input box and the submit button

## File Explorer
Here I recommend looking at the way VS Code handles it for inspiration.
- change the styles for the folders and files
- the user should be able to distinguish files/folders by sight
- the file/folder that the user's mouse is over should get highlighted
